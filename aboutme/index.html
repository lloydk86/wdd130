        Hi, I'm Lloyd. I'm currently exploring a career in urban planning and sustainability, with a strong interest in applying global research to local challenges in Durban. I'm also pursuing professional development in web design through BYU-Idaho’s Software Development studies.

      <p>
        I love organizing complex research and turning it into actionable solutions. Whether it's improving informal settlements or enhancing food security, I’m passionate about making a positive impact in my community. I also enjoy web development and troubleshooting HTML/CSS to ensure clean, functional design.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for more than 20 years. One of my favorite scriptures is Mosiah 2:17: “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.” It inspires my work and learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this course, I hope to sharpen my technical skills and use web design to support community-based projects, educational outreach, and digital sustainability efforts. I’m excited to grow and collaborate with others who share a vision for meaningful change.
